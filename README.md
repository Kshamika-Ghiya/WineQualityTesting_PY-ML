# WineQualityTesting_PY-ML

The aim of this case study is to predict wine quality based on physicochemical data.

In this study a large dataset was taken from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository which included 4898 instances of white wine with 11 physicochemical data.
In this, I learnt how to use different models of machine learning to classify the wines as well as figure out the importance of each chemical analysis parameters in the wine and which to ignore.
This case study helped me understand how to perform data analysis using machine learning and python programming language.
